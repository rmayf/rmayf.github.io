I've discovered I require complete focus when I'm trying to write.  I'm sensitive to noise distrationsThere can't be any bings, dings, dongs, rustles, alarms.  Maybe this will get better with practice but right now I need full concentration to keep my fingers up to speed with my thoughts.  A single typo can derail the entire train and block the thought from getting out. 

Sometimes I find it annoying to have spell check enable while I'm writing.  It's distracting to have a red squiggle appear under a word, even if it's mispelled, because it's not relevant at the time of it being written.  I like to go back AFTER I'm done writing and fix my typos, but during the process find spell check to be a real hamper on my writing "flow".  Also, my brain fixates on the red squiggle, nagging me to be fixed, and I feel unable to continue writing unless I go back and fix it, which knocks me out of my train of thought and makes it really hard to write anything of value.  If you're like me and get distracted easily, especially while writing, then I recommend disabling you spell checker during the "flow" section of your writing. Just write.  Get the thoughts out of your brain onto the page.  It doesn't have to be pretty or well formatted or make sense or be spelled correctly, it just has to be out of your head and on the paper.  Then later go back and edit it so it reads well and makes sense and doesn't have any spelling errors, you'll be surprised at just how much more you can get done with this technique. Anyways, onwards! I've figured it out so you don't have to.  I use StackEdit to write my blog posts, which is great because it already has most of what I want, however, it does have a spell check feature which is the worst kind.  EVEN WHILE YOU'RE STILL TYPING A WORD it underlines it and flashes with each character you type.  Anyways, it's pretty easy to disable it, it's actually not a StackEdit feature but a Chrome feature, so just go to your chrome [settings](chrome://settings/languages), expand the `Advanced` tab at the bottom, and toggle off `Spell check`.  Bingo, bango, bongo, the red squiggly is no more! Hurrah, you can write without feeling like your brain is going to explode from watching the red squiggly flash with every new character you type. Now you have no excuse not to become the next Hemmingway.
