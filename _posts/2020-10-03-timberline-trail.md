<p>“Is it ACRES?” I say aloud, breaking the low monotonous drone of the car.  “Yeah, that fits!” responds a mumbled voice in my earbud.  I’m helping out via phone on my team’s weekly Friday crossword puzzle.  They’re all on a video confrence but since we’re passing through questionable service, I have to phone in instead.  Sierra’s driving and only hears my side of the conversation; she must have no idea how this relates to my job.   Knowing fun facts about the size of National Parks does come in handy, even as a software engineer.</p>
<p>I’m “working from car” today because we’re aiming to squeeze in one last backpacking trip before summer’s over.  I figured it would be convienet to fit in a quick trip on our way up to Washington for my cousin’s wedding.  Our aim is a 41 mile trek circumnavigating the base of Mt. Hood, the Timberline Trail.  This route caught my eye the previous summer; it shares a portion with the Pacific Crest Trail, which I was completing as my first long distance thru-hike.  One unfortunate aspect of hiking the entire west coast in a single season is that you don’t have much time for lollygagging.  I distinctly remember being enamoured with the Mt. Hood wilderness and making a mental note to come back and experience it at a more leisurly pace.  Now was my opportunity for just that.</p>
<p>We’re somewhere in southern Oregon heading up highway 97.  Imperceptible changes to the landscape have taken their toll; it’s obvious we’re not in California anymore.  The distinction however is mostly by map as the rolling green hills look no different than those we passed 30 minutes ago.  A prominently displayed yellow flag adorned with offset black Xs reminds me we’re <em>actually</em> not in Oregon, not yet.  In fact, we left California hundreds of miles ago when we crossed into Mendocino County, the start of the proposed State of Jefferson.  It’s still just a concept but it’s very real to the people who reside here.  I can’t help but feel like we don’t belong amid the big trucks belching black smoke out their stovepipe exhausts.  This is what I like to call “Trump’s America” and feels like a foreign country compared to the progressive mindset of the Bay Area.  Don’t mind us liberals though, we’re just passing through.</p>
<p>We pull into the Best Western parking lot in Government Camp after dark.  It’s too late to start the trail and we both agree it’s best to get a good night’s sleep instead.  By now the summer crowd has dwindled so the hotel is deserted.  The front desk attendant is a middle aged woman who’s unexpectedly chipper for this hour.  I admire the 3d printed pen holder on the counter, which she explains is her coworker’s who will be on shift tomorrow afternoon.  I almost forget my credit card on the counter and crack a joke about how she could have used it to buy herself useless stuff on Amazon.  She laughs and tells Sierra “You’re husband is funny, you’re lucky!”.  We’re not married; in fact we’ve been together less than a year now but get that comment all the time.  It’s a running joke amongst our friends that we eloped during one of our previous trips to Washington and are already secretly married.</p>

<p>The next morning is a slow start followed by nervous packing and repacking in the Timberline Lodge parking area.  Best known for it’s role as the creepy Overlook Hotel from “The Shining”, today the lodge serves as our starting point.  The autumnal air is crisp and clear with views of limitless green forest sweeping down from my vantage.  The mountain peak is so close, it’s skewed aspect looks like a wall rising up behind the steepled roof.  The ritzy lodge patrons out for a morning stroll can’t help but stare as I struggle into my hiking pants while avoiding the dirty pavement.  Gravity eventually wins out and I’m forced to step off my shoe-top safeguard to prevent a faceplant.  I don’t know what all this fuss is about anyway, it’s not like I’m getting dressed for a wedding.  The dusty miles will soon have their way with my attire and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.</p>
<p>Shallow "U"s gleam as they move in and out of the lightbeams filtering through the canopy.  Wiggling softly in the afternoon breeze, the narrow strands look alive and unnatural hundreds of feet above our heads.  Spiders have somehow managed to erect webs across a canyon, carved over the millenia by the river we’re using as a rest stop.  “How did they get those all the way up there?” Asks Sierra when she notices my gaze.  “They’re smarter than we think” I reply, going over the estimation in my head for how much each of those strands must weight.  I determine the spiders could have built these webs in one of two ways:  Either by attaching one end of the line, crawling down the canyon wall, across the river, and up the other side to complete the bridge - all while extending the thread from it’s thorax and keeping it free of snags.  Otherwise,  the spider waited for a gust of wind, said it’s prayers, and jumped.</p>
<p>Something catches my eye standing out amid the typical browns of the forest floor.  I bend over to investigate and come up with a small corner of a Clif bar wrapper.  I wonder how many other people have seen this garbage and just walked on by.  Did the culprit knowingly toss this aside, or did they have the intention of proper disposal but an innocent slip out of a pocket? I picture a hiker so stricken with hunger they shred the wrapper in an animalistic stupor to get at the caloric lump inside.  Regardless, I’ll pack it out, because no one else has and no one else probably will.  “Leave No Trace” means <strong>no trace</strong> and last time I checked, Clif bars don’t grow around here.</p>

<p>The next day we’re quickly met with our first roadblock.  Downed trees from a recent record-breaking wind storm block our progress.  The blowdowns form an obstacle course of branches, bows, and limbs.  We spend all day navigating the horizontal forest.  The trail is nowhere to be seen, it’s more of a general direction rather than a footpath.  I realize I’ve lost Sierra and blow a shrill whistle in order to echo locate her. No response.  I whistle again, louder, worried she has fallen and needs help. Silence.  I begrudgingly get up off the log where I’m perched to retrace my steps and begin the search party procedure.  Then, I see her yellow cap bob above a branch in the distance.  She sticks her toungue out and makes a farting noise in response to my becons.  It’s her signal for “everything’s all right” although this bushwhacking is more than she signed on for.</p>
<p>We emerge from the blowdown 6 hours later, having only traveled 5 miles.  Sierra looks as if she was locked in a room with angry cats; every exposed piece of skin is covered by long red scratches. Our hands and clothes are stained with dark sap blotches and we reek of pine.  “You owe me a new pair of pants” she states plainly when we stop to rest once the trail clears.  I don’t see how I’m at fault for tearing holes in her leggings but it’s best not to argue at times like this.</p>
<p>The sun starts to drop and we pick up the pace on account of the dismal milage we had accomplished.  It’s all worth it as we come around the ridge and see Mt. Hood, bathed in the waning pink light.  If we’d been “on schedule”, we never would have seen the mountain here, now, in in all its glory.  “I’m going to throw up it’s so pretty” says Sierra.  I couldn’t agree more.</p>

<p>The trip ends a day before we’re actually done.  You reach a tipping point on any long hike where you know you’re going to accomplish your goal so there’s nothing left to worry about.  From that point on, the rest of the trip is about going through the motions; mentally, you’re already back at the car.  It’s bad in some regards, we should focus on enjoying our present situation instead of looking ahead for what’s next. I love being surrounded by the tranquil beauty of the wilderness and can’t wait to get out for my next adventure.  On the other hand, there’s so much to look forward to about rediscovering the simple ammenites of modern society.  Something taken for granted just a few days before nows becomes a source of renewed fascination. You don’t <em>need</em> hot food, cotton underwear, and running water to survive, but they sure are nice.</p>
