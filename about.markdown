Hello, I'm Reid!  Welcome to my inconspicuous corner of the vast internet expanse.  Hope you stay for awhile, kick your feet up, and let your troubles wash away.  If you haven't already noticed, I use two spaces after periods in between sentences.  If you feel strongly otherwise, now's a good time to leave...

I'm from Seattle, Washington.  Well not *Seattle* Seattle.  No one's from Seattle, although everyone who lives in 100 miles of the city claims to be.  Like all good Pacific Northwesterns, I love being outside.  In 2019, I hiked 2,653 miles from Mexico to Canada up the west coast of the United States along the Pacific Crest Trail.  I completed the trek in 136 days and walked an average of 19 miles per day.  Since then, I've been chasing snow storms in the winter months to fuel my powder addiction while planning my next adventure (CDT 2020 anyone?).

When I'm not sleeping in a tent on the ground (for fun), I'm staring at a screen.  I'm a lead software engineer at Arista Networks building the world's most resilient enterprise networking equipment.  Although Arista is a great place to work, I have a love-hate relationship with software.  I hate being sedentary for long periods of time but love problem solving and building things.  I built a 3D printer from scratch and wrote a photo sharing web app for my brother in a single night.
