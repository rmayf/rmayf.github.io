Hello, I'm Reid!  Welcome to my inconspicuous corner of the vast internet expanse.  Hope you stay for awhile, kick your feet up, and let your troubles wash away.  If you haven't already noticed, I use two spaces after periods in between sentences.  If you feel strongly about having only a single space between the end of the previous sentence and the beginning of the next, now's a good time to leave...

I'm from Seattle, Washington.  Well not *Seattle* Seattle.  No one's from Seattle, although everyone who lives in 100 miles of the city claims to be.  Like all good Pacific Northwesterns, I love being outside.  In 2019, I hiked 2,653 miles from Mexico to Canada up the West coast of the United States along the Pacific Crest Trail. In the winter months, I'm chasing snow storms
