Hello, I'm Reid!  Welcome to my inconspicuous corner of the vast internet expanse.  Hope you stay for awhile, kick your feet up, and let your troubles wash away.  If you haven't already noticed, I use two spaces after periods in between sentences.  If you feel strongly about having only a single space between the end of the previous sentence and the beginning of the next, now's a good time to leave...

I'm from Federal Way, Washington, but people outside
