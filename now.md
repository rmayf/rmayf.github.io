I'm on an extended trip to San Diego with my girlfriend [Sierra](https://somewheresierra.com/index.php/aboutme/).  We wanted to take advantage of working remotely and I'm fulfilling my life long dream of becoming a grom.   While we still live in Santa Clara, we're both interested in moving down here in the near future.

 I've been fixated on staying hydrated and aim to drink 4L of water daily.  Phone, keys, wallet, (facemask, ) and water sack are always on my person.  I've been getting better sleep on account of the hydration; now waking up isn't so painful.  Never thought I'd see the day where I'm awake before 10am without an alarm.

I've started [bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/).  This practice helps me find mental clarity and stay focused throughout the day.  I feel like I've been getting more done while being less stressed about my work-life.

My sister is pregnant!  This is my first foray into being an uncle.  Wonder if I'll be the "cool uncle" ðŸ¤”.
