<h1 id="what-im-doing-now">What I’m doing now</h1>
<p>I’m on an extended trip to San Diego with my girlfriend <a href="https://somewheresierra.com/index.php/aboutme/">Sierra</a>.  We wanted to take advantage of working remotely and I’m fulfilling my life long dream of becoming a grom.   While we still live in Santa Clara, we’re both interested in moving down here in the near future.</p>
<p>I’ve been fixated on staying hydrated and aim to drink 4L of water daily.  Phone, keys, wallet, (facemask, ) and water sack are always on my person.  I’ve been getting better sleep on account of the hydration; now waking up isn’t so painful.  Never thought I’d see the day where I’m awake before 10am without an alarm.</p>
<p>I’ve started <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">bullet journaling</a>.  This practice helps me find mental clarity and stay focused throughout the day.  I feel like I’ve been getting more done while being less stressed about my work-life.</p>
<p>My sister is pregnant!  This is my first foray into being an uncle.  Wonder if I’ll be the “cool uncle” 🤔.</p>
