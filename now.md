We were back up in Washington for 2 weeks for my Cousin's wedding.  It was a whirlwind trip where we did so much and yet didn't have time for everything.  Sierra's brother has moved back home (into her room) so we both stayed with my parents.  We also made a weekend trip down to Long Beach for a clam tide.  It was rainy but warm and the clams were plentiful!  We're now on the way back down to the Bay Area because our plants need water and we're both tired of living out of a suitcase.

I finally finished interviewing with Facebook.  It only tooks 6 months for them to reject me.  Big tech companies have the most fucked up interview process imaginable.  I hope someone or something comes along one day and changes technical interviews for the better, but I just don't see that happening anytime soon.  Oh well, back to the drawing board, I didn't even really want to work there anyways *salty face*.

We're looking for a new place to live.  Sierra and I are both eager to have our own space and try living somewhere new.  Although Santa Clara has been my home now for 6 years, I've never really been sold on this area for the long term.  We're currently focused on Santa Cruz to be closer to the beach and so I can chase my dreams of being a surfer bum.  The rent is too damn high there due to the mas exodus of tech workers with recently aquired remote work freedom.
