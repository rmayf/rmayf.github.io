It's almost been an entire year since I've updated this page and my how the times have been a'changing.  Sierra and I are full blown Santa Cruz residents and it's great.  I'm starting to get the hang of surfing, the locs accept me as one of their own.  Early morning, floating just off the coast watching the waves roll in.  A flock of pelicans soar past headed west.  It's misty and the ocean breathes salty.  It's heaven.  The bounds of yourself dissolve with the motion of the swell and it's impossible to distinguish the difference between body and body of water.
